## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Merged characterization tests (TEST-01) into Phase 1 to ensure safety net exists before any refactoring
- [Roadmap]: Combined module extraction, testing, and type safety into Phase 2 since they are tightly coupled (can't test modules that don't exist yet)
- [Roadmap]: Research recommends pure-functions-first extraction order (url-builder, setup-shortcuts first, then navigation, then stateful modules)
- [Phase 01]: Used @ts-expect-error for Firefox-only cookieStoreId API to catch future Chrome types updates
- [Phase 01]: vitest-chrome requires explicit ESM path import due to CJS/ESM incompatibility with Vitest 4.x
- [Phase 01]: Created representative Salesforce API fixtures manually when SF CLI auth was unavailable
- [Phase 01]: Mocked React/ReactDOM entirely for window-manager characterization tests to avoid JSX compilation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 may need deeper research on circular dependency patterns in window-manager.ts
- Phase 3 may need research on Zustand + Plasmo content script lifecycle interaction
